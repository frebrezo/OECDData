# OECDData

Project is an exercise in learning Node and Angular. Yes, there's no Angular yet.

## Node
Web service layer to generically transform OECD data into consumable format by Angular web application.

### To date
Service layer reads data from generic OECD source (currently only tested with HH_DASH) and transforms data into CSV format.

## Angular
Web application to visualize OECD data.

### To date
N/A. Sorry.
